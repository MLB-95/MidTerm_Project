# Mid-Term Project
Repository for the Mid-term Ironhack Data Analytics' course project.

## Members of the group
Ã‰rica D'Alessandro Junho de Lemos and Miguel Bayer.

## Goal of the project
It's a BI project about CO2 emission across the world (from 1980 until 2020) and how they could be related to each countries population, different energy types and GDP.

## Brief description of the dataset
The dataset we're going to explore was build by a Kaggle user (Benjamin Vanous) using data produced by the US Energy Information Administration. It has 55440 rows and 10 features:
1. country;
2. energy type;
3. the year the data was recorded;
4. the amount of consumption for the specific energy source (quad Btu);
5. the amount of production for the specific energy source (quad Btu);
6. Country's GDP at purchasing power parities (Billion 2015$ PPP);
7. population of specific country;
8. energy intensity (MMBtu/person);
9. energy intensity by GDP;
10. the amount of C02 emitted (MMtonnes CO2)).

- Setting the correct type of data;
- Filtering data;
- Checking for duplicates;
- Correcting typos;
- Handling missing values.
#### Day 2: Exploring the data
- Looking for patterns;
- Deciding which dimensions to use;
- Insights about the data;
- Finding the story behind the data.
#### Day 3: Plotting
- Plotting graphics using Tableau.
#### Day 4: Presentation
