Miguel:
- GDP/Country
- Energy production per Energy type
- Renewable energy production per regions
- Energy production per region
- Energy connsumption per country
- Energy production per country
- CO2 emissions/GDP
- CO2 emission/country
- CO2 emissions per energy source

Erica:
- CO2 emissions and energy intensity (gdp) - **Done**
- CO2 emissions per regions for all years - **Done**
- CO2 emissions per energy type (which one is worse for the environment) - **Done**
- CO2 emissions per population for all years - **Done**


Storytelling:
- 1st we show how the GDP increased in those years in all countries (map plot)
- Then the high correlation between GDP and CO2 emissions (Erica's correlation plot for regions)
- After that we show how the consumption and production of energy has increased (per country/region and per energy type)
- We show the CO2 emissions per energy type
- Then the Co2 emissions for the most important/biggest countries, pointing that developed countries Co2 emissions have been more stable, while other countries (China and India) have increased the emissions while they have been developing
- After that we can maybe take those countries (China, India and Russia or Brazil) and compare their GDP growth, with their emissions and their population growth (I don't know if we can put so many variables in one plot)


1) How CO2 is responsible for the incrising temperatures on earth (text) and how the different energy sources colaborate to CO2 liberation (CO2 emissions per type plot)
2) How, despite that, and despite the fact that some regions seem to have controlled their CO2 emissions, CO2 emisisons is still growing worldwide, specially due to the increase in Asia emissions (CO2 by regions per years plot - we can use the map or the lines, or both)
3) Show that CO2 emissions are growing more then the global population (CO2 emissions per population per years plot)
4) How CO2 emissions and GDP are intensily related (Erica's correlation plot for regions)
5) And how GDP increased in those years in all countries (map plot)
6) The Co2 emissions for the most important/biggest countries, pointing that developed countries Co2 emissions have been more stable, while other countries (China and India) have increased the emissions while they have been developing
7) How the consumption and production of energy has increased (per country/region and per energy type), highlighting that renewable sources, that are more eco-friendly, also increased
8) Conclusion
