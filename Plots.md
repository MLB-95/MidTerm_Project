Miguel:
- GDP/Country
- Energy production per Energy type
- Renewable energy production per regions
- Energy production per region
- Energy connsumption per country
- Energy production per country
- CO2 emissions/GDP
- CO2 emission/country
- CO2 emissions per energy source

Erica:
- CO2 emissions and energy intensity (gdp) - **Done**
- CO2 emissions per regions for all years - **Done**
- CO2 emissions per energy type (which one is worse for the environment) - **Done**
- CO2 emissions per population for all years - **Done**


Storytelling:
- 1st we show how the GDP increased in those years in all countries (map plot)
- Then the high correlation between GDP and CO2 emissions (Erica's correlation plot for regions)
- After that we show how the consumption and production of energy has increased (per country/region and per energy type)
- We show the CO2 emissions per energy type
- Then the Co2 emissions for the most important/biggest countries, pointing that developed countries Co2 emissions have been more stable, while other countries (China and India) have increased the emissions while they have been developing
- After that we can maybe take those countries (China, India and Russia or Brazil) and compare their GDP growth, with their emissions and their population growth (I don't know if we can put so many variables in one plot)
